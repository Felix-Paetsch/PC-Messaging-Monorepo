Allow for advanced communication channels:

-   Under the hood several channels
-   Retry logic
-   Notify kernel
-   Allowing to keep middleware
-   Error handlung callbacks & cokg

-   send remove message before remove
-   look at current things
-   less effect in martin initialization
-   why do i need this one type inference?
-   better remove functionality -> in particular call on_remove messages
-   allow async callbacks everywhere
