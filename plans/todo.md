Allow for advanced communication channels:

-   Under the hood several channels
-   Retry logic
-   Notify kernel
-   Allowing to keep middleware
-   Error handlung callbacks & cokg

-   look at current things
-   less effect in martin initialization
-   allow async callbacks everywhere
-   testing (an array/set of test scenarios that should just work)
